# Airranix
Or my personal system Nix configuration to explore a non-flake way of management and other new and interesting projects.
The plan is to include the following compared to my previous flake based approach:

- Flakes (Dependancy Pinning) -> [Npins](https://github.com/andir/npins)
- Flakes (Project Management) -> [Nilla](https://github.com/nilla-nix/nilla)
- Flakes (New CLI) -> [Nilla-CLI](https://github.com/nilla-nix/cli)
- Home Manager -> [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem)/[Hjem-Rum](https://github.com/snugnug/hjem-rum)
- Secrets = [sopsWarden](https://github.com/pfassina/sopswarden)
- ???

This will be used to manage:

- Airradda-PC (Desktop)
- Airradda-Laptop (Laptop) 
- And possibly:
  - Airradda-Server (Server)
  - Airradda-HomeLab (Server)

# Notes
This also serves as a way to get myself more familar a [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) based workflow and out of the habit of working on main.
Additionally, I might use this to explore [git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug) as way of managing issues as to not tie myself to GitHub, assuming it doesn't cause problems with [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj).
